# Telecom Customer Churn Analytics ðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom dataset and builds predictive models to identify customers likely to leave.  
It also includes an **interactive Looker Studio dashboard** for business insights.  

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python, Pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Feature Importance Analysis (Top 10 churn factors)
- Interactive Dashboard (Google Looker Studio) with:
  - Churn Rate %
  - Revenue Lost from Churn
  - Churn by Contract Type, Payment Method, Tenure
  - Key KPIs

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Google Looker Studio** (Interactive Dashboard)
- **Git/GitHub** (Version Control)
